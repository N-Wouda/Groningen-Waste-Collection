# Notes

Municipality is faced with two problems.
The first is that they would like to forecast full containers more reliably.
Using that forecast of a set of nearly full containers, they then want to cluster the container set into a number of groups, such that one garbage truck can visit one group in a single day.
This is the second problem: how to efficiently cluster containers?
